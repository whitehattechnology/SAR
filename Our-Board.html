                                <p class="card-text mbr-section-text text-2">Daniel is the founder of Self of Awareness &amp; Recovery (SAR), a former inmate, and is a passionate reform and rehabilitation advocate.  He was sentenced to state prison at 19 years old, and served 38 years; before being paroled.  While serving time, he completed many rehab programs, but there was one program in particular that opened the doors to his second chance at life: Houses of Healing .  This experience gave him the inspiration to create his own rehab program, and thus Self Awareness and Recovery was born.  Had there been intervention and rehabilitation programs earlier in his development, Daniel believes that more of his years would have been spent on the outside helping others, as opposed to being locked-up on the inside - both figuratively and literally.  It is his mission to fight for those who have no one to fight for them, by intervening before young people get stuck in the system, as well as advocating for the rehabilitation and healing of those who remain inside prison.<br></p>

                                <p class="card-text mbr-section-text text-2">Eryka is passionate about helping people in and out of her community. Specifically, at risk youth
and those in the forensic population. She is a firm believer in preventive rather than reactive
<br>intervention when deterring the youth from a delinquent path. Furthermore, she believes people
can change with proper education, guidance and will to become productive members in our
communities. She does not believe people are defined by their crimes, there is always a root cause
which can be addressed and fixed if the individual is willing to do the work.
<br>She has been a member of the Self Awareness and Recovery (SAR) team since 2017, she is both a
facilitator and educator for the SAR. &nbsp;Her educational background consists of a B.A in Psychology
with a Minor in Criminal Justice Administration. Currently, she is a second year student persuing a master degree in clinical counseling program. Her goal is to earn her degree, get licensed and use her knowledge to further help those in need.<br></p>

She received a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice from CSUS and during the course of those studies she became interested in the area of correctional practices, specifically as pertaining to vulnerable populations including inmates with mental illness.  She has been active in the area of supporting the successful reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals and has been a facilitator of evidence-based programs in community corrections and on campus at California State University, Sacramento.  She is also a certified SAR facilitator and has participated in SAR's train-the-trainer programs for people who are incarcerated. Faith's specific research interests involve the exploration of narratives of those whom incarceration most impacts, the individuals who have served time in prison.  Focusing on carceral practices affecting mental health of inmates, and utilizing the framework of Peacemaking Criminology, Faith seeks to explore ideas for eradicating suffering and building a foundation of non-violence wherein returning citizens can be integrated into a healthy society and have productive lives.<br></p>
